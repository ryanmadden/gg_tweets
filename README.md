A python NLP program to analyze tweets from the Golden Globes 
We did not use any additional library Originally we attempted NLTK, but realized it was too slow.
We did not consult any other respoitory.
The program is designed for any future Golden Globe awards, simply by preloading the the list of nominees and presenters.
